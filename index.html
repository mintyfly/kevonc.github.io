      <span class="date">September 9, 2016</span>
      <span class="excerpt"><p>If you were just on any job portal like JobsDB or LinkedIn looking for a job, you might want to read this blog post because you have been finding jobs the wrong way. Everyone knows that finding a job is hard, almost as hard as finding your significant half. What’s worse is, when you start dating someone you don’t like that much, which is kind of like taking a job you’re not so interested in. Now, if you want to find a job that you actually enjoy, read on. Disclaimer: this is more for a startup job.</p>

      <span class="date">August 28, 2016</span>
      <span class="excerpt"><p>Ever since Michelle and I read Tony Hsieh’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446576220/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0446576220&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=kevon-20&amp;linkId=ee5073a25ed1b1b4a5750837accd88b3" target="_blank">Delivering Happiness</a>, we were intrigued by the way Tony runs Zappos and how culture plays a major role in the building of the shoe empire. Nowadays, a respectable company is not represented by its huge revenue or operating margin, a more convincing way of measuring is through its impact on the world and its employee’s happiness. In the book, Tony mentioned that there are only 3 key areas that are worth investing into when everything else could be copied easily, and the trio is a brand, culture, and pipeline. With a huge admiration towards building a well-defined company culture, I want to talk about how we define our culture at <a href="http://firstcodeacademy.com" target="_blank">First Code Academy</a>.</p>

      <span class="excerpt"><p>There are so many life mottos out there from all these famous people; for me, I believe everyone should have a personal set of life mottos and it is worth writing them down so we can remind ourselves from time to time.</p>

      <span class="date">January 16, 2016</span>
      <span class="excerpt"><p>Year 2016 is the first year I am drafting up a detailed annual plan for myself. After reading Chris Guillebeau’s <a href="http://chrisguillebeau.com/how-to-conduct-your-own-annual-review/" target="_blank">“How to Conduct Your Own Annual Review”</a>, I came up with 14 measureable targets in the fields of Relationship (Family &amp; Friends), Finance, Health, Learning, and Travel. I didn’t set a target for reading books because it is a no brainer for me that I must and will read a lot. It is funny because I hated reading in my childhood, and now I treat books as one of my closest friends, so I spent some time making a list of books I will read in 2016. I hope you’ll find some of them interesting, and please also share with me what you’re reading!

      <span class="date">November 24, 2015</span>
      <span class="excerpt"><p>One night over dinner, a college friend asked me “What is your life goal?” It was definitely a rare question that not many peers have asked me at this stage of our lives. It was a tough question! I don’t know what life goals I have because it changes all the time. If you asked me in primary school, I would have given you the standard “a businessman” answer. In high school, you might hear “an investment banker who makes a lot of money”. And then in college, you probably hear “an aspiring figure who stands out from the crowd”.</p>
