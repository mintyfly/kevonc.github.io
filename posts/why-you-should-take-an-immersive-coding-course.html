      <h5 class="tagline">"it does not get you to expertise, yet it jumpstarts you"</h5>
    
    <p>Today is Week 4 Day 5, and I cannot believe one third of the course has gone by so quickly. I’ve gathered a list of technical topics I want to share, but I can’t seem to find the time to write about them because I’m constantly working on my applications. Today I am going to talk about the difference between learning coding at home using online resources versus taking an immersive course with instructors and other students. I feel that a lot of people also have this concern in mind, “Hey, the course is so expensive, is it worth it?”</p>

<p>I self taught myself how to code a few months before I enroll into WDI at GA, so I took countless codeschool or codeacademy exercises, read about ten books about different topics such as Ruby, Rails, jQuery etc, did a few tutorials, and built a few simple app with Rails. I did not know how much I taught myself until I’m writing this blog post right now. Nevertheless, I still decided to join an immersive course in New York because they provide experience you’ll never get on your own. I constantly ask myself, “Is this the right decision?”, and to be honest, I was asking myself the same question in Week 1 because I have seen or tried writing so much code in the past few months that learning from the basics seem like learning algebra 2 again.</p>

<p>So we started off the course learning Ruby, then Sinatra, and now Rails with a bunch of small topics in between. I slowly realized I was wrong. Teaching myself really did get me a jump start to start building with the help of Rails and the dozens of gems out there, but I never really truly understand what each line does. Learning from basics got me thinking, even a simple Ruby program or a Rails app without scaffold become good practice for me. Yesterday I was helping another student for about an hour and half with his Rails app, and do you know how I felt? I felt like a ninja because I understand the connection between codes in Model, View, and Controller! I’m able to explain and guide someone else.</p>

<p>Learning from basics and getting plenty of practice is just one reason why I would recommend taking an immersive course. The other reasons kicked in this week as we had a panel of Rails developer coming in to speak about their experience and career journey, and give legit advice on how to get there. We also had a field trip yesterday to a New York Startup called <a href="http://www.howaboutwe.com/" target="_blank">How About We</a>. I’ve been to the website before and I thought it is a young startup with maybe 10 employees max, and I was truly impressed when I walked in I to room  of about 30 people (thats just half of them). The best part is yet to come, <a href="http://wearenytech.com/66-aaron-schildkrout-co-founder-and-co-ceo-of-howaboutwe-com" target="_blank">CEO Aaron Schildkrout</a>, gave us a talk about development process which starts from ideation, to quarterly evaluate new ideas, to how design and development team have sprints to carry out production. I was smiling the whole time simply because I was amazed with all these things, I was fascinated! I’ve always been interested in startup and there is so much knowledge out there I want to learn. I thought to myself, “This is exactly the environment I want to be in, and this is exactly the process and work I love.” Leaving their office with tons of enlightenment, I know I picked the right path that I love, and I know I made a good decision joining an immersive course because it opens up more knowledge to me than sitting in front of my laptop at home every day.</p>
